The numerical solver makes use of the stochastic formalism (see: [Hardwick, Vennin & Wands (2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2018/05/070)) and computes the IR correlation functions of quantum fields during cosmic inflation in n-field dimensions. This is a necessary 1-loop resummation of the correlation functions to render them finite.

# Current version

The code now supports the implementation of n-numbers of coupled test fields (energetically sub-dominant) as well as non-test fields. There is an example notebook in the repository to help get you started.

# Getting started

To fork, simply type into the terminal:

> git clone https://github.com/umbralcalc/nfield.git
